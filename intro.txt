GPU programming is a technique typically used to speed up computations by
taking advantage of the highly parallel architecture available on graphics
cards. There will be many live code demos, mostly in C++/CUDA, but should be
understandable by all.





Title: Intro to General Purpose GPU programming

Summary:
Within the last few years graphics cards have become very popular within high
performance computing circles.  This presentation will give an introduction to
GPGPU programming along with code examples, as well as a discussion of which
problem domains would likely see benefit from using it.
